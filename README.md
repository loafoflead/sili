# SILI (silly)

## WORK IN PROGRESS!!! MAXIMALLY UNFINISHED!!!

Sili is a programming language I'm planning for use in a learn to code game. 

Written in the Rust programming language, but only because I don't know OCaml.

The syntax is heavily inspired by languages like Odin and Jai, if I ever get around to 
implementing a type system, it will be inspired by Rust, the language I'm writing this 
language in. 

The language doesn't compile to anything yet (although it will likely be interpreted),
I'm just at the parsing stage.
